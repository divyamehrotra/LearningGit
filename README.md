# LearningGit
 

Sure, here is an article summarizing everything required for Git and GitHub:

What is Git?

Git is a version control system (VCS). A VCS is a system that helps you track changes to your code over time. This can be useful for a variety of reasons, such as:

Backup: Git can be used to create a backup of your code, so that you can always revert to a previous version if something goes wrong.
Collaboration: Git can be used to collaborate with others on a project, by allowing you to share your code and track changes made by others.
Debugging: Git can be used to track down bugs in your code, by allowing you to compare different versions of your code.
What is GitHub?

GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories. This means that you can use GitHub to store your Git repositories online, and access them from anywhere. GitHub also provides a number of features that make it easy to collaborate on projects, such as issue tracking and pull requests.

How do Git and GitHub work together?

Git and GitHub work together by storing your Git repositories on GitHub. This means that you can access your code from anywhere, and collaborate with others on your projects.
